instead of "slabs" we have "pieces", which are 1/4 size of the block
i don't want jumping to be necessary, so the world spawns in pieces, not in blocks
with only your hand, you can only destroy pieces, tools give the ability to destroy blocks
hitbox is drawn over 1 "block" or "slab" based on its position in space
destroying 1 "block" will just get you 4 pieces of material still
some blocks are brittle and not drop anything, or drop randomly
glass and obsidian doesn't drop anything when broken
glass can be obtained by smelting sand in blast furnace
obsidian piece by itself cannot be obtained, but casting lava into a shape you want will make an obsidian part
it is always 1 part per 1 unit of lava
for example, obsidian blade that can be made into a sword
pieces of rock spawn on the surface grass sometimes on one of 4 corners of the block

ores are not blocks, but pieces that spawn in palce of rock pieces sometimes

obsidian tools break really quickly, but also do lots of damage, one-hitting almost any mob
diamond tools do 3 times less damage than obsidian, but do not break for a long time

tools mine faster than hands, but they do not increase mining speed with upgrades

nothing can be infinitely repaired, everything breaks eventually
however tools also serve more time normally than in minecraft

shift-mining mines only bits, not whole blocks

bit textures are just 1/4th of 16x16 texture that is placed based on x/y coordinates

todo: how do water and lava physics work?

todo: maybe there are even "bits" which are 1/8th of a block or 1/16th?
