Martha aint real in John

Domine Jesu Christe, Fili Dei, miserere mei, peccatoris.

Ave Joseph, fili David, juste, vir Mariæ, de qua natus est Jesus qui vocatur
Christus. Sancte Joseph, pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi, ora pro nobis
clientibus tuis, nunc et in hora mortis nostræ.

No, the hand of the Lord is not too short to save,
    nor his ear too dull to hear.
Rather, it is your crimes
    that separate you from your God,
It is your sins that make him hide his face
    so that he does not hear you.

Proverbs 24:17-18
Do not rejoice when your enemies fall,
    and do not let your heart be glad when they stumble,
or else the Lord will see it and be displeased,
    and turn away his anger from them.

Pope Leo I about Papacy and Constantinople
In his letter to the Emperor, he observes in the first place that the claims
of the patriarch of Constantinople are based upon political considerations
and have nothing in common with the primacy of St. Peter which is of divine
institution. “Secular things stand upon a different footing from things
divine; and apart from the one Rock which the Lord has laid for a foundation,
no building can be stable . . . Let it suffice him” (the patriarch Anatolius)
“that he has obtained the bishopric of so great a city with the aid of your
piety and the support of my favor. He should not disdain the royal city,
even though he cannot change it into an apostolic see; and let him on no
account hope to succeed in exalting his own position at the expense of others
. . . Let him remember that it is to me that the government of the Church
has been entrusted. I should be responsible if the rules of the Church were
infringed through my acquiescence (far be it from me!) or if the will of a
single brother had more weight with me than the common good of the Lord’s
whole house.” 1 “The agreements of the bishops which are contrary to
the holy canons of Nicæa . . . we declare to be null and void, and by the
authority of the blessed Apostle Peter we annul them completely by a general
decree.” 2 In his reply to the petition of the bishops of the fourth council,
the Pope confirms his approval of their dogmatic decree (formulated on the lines
of his own letter to Flavian) as well as his annulment of the twenty-eighth
Canon. “Your Holiness will be able,” he writes, “to appreciate the
reverence with which the Apostolic See observes the rules of the holy Fathers,
by reading my writings in which I have rejected the claims of the bishop of
Constantinople; and you will understand that I am, with the help of the Lord,
the guardian of the Catholic faith and of the decrees of the Fathers.”

Bishop of Salonica, letter to Anastasius, about Papacy:
Even among the blessed Apostles, there was side by side with an equality
of honor a distinction of authority; and though all were equally chosen,
nevertheless pre-eminence was given to one over the others. On the same
principle, distinction is made between bishops, and the mighty design of
Providence has ordered it that all may not claim every prerogative, but that
in each province there should be someone possessing primacy of jurisdiction
(literally: “prime judgment”) over his brethren; and again that those
presiding in the larger cities should receive a wider responsibility, that
through them the care of the Universal Church might ultimately rest upon the
one see of Peter and that no part should anywhere be separated from the head.
