Martha aint real in John

Domine Jesu Christe, Fili Dei, miserere mei, peccatoris.

Ave Joseph, fili David, juste, vir Mariæ, de qua natus est Jesus qui vocatur
Christus. Sancte Joseph, pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi, ora pro nobis
clientibus tuis, nunc et in hora mortis nostræ.

No, the hand of the Lord is not too short to save,
    nor his ear too dull to hear.
Rather, it is your crimes
    that separate you from your God,
It is your sins that make him hide his face
    so that he does not hear you.

Proverbs 24:17-18
Do not rejoice when your enemies fall,
    and do not let your heart be glad when they stumble,
or else the Lord will see it and be displeased,
    and turn away his anger from them.
