Kami no haha, Sei Maria, watashi-tachi no tame ni inotte kudasai.
神の母聖マリア私達の為に祈って下さい。

Domine Jesu Christe, Fili Dei, miserere mei, peccatoris.

Ave Joseph, fili David, juste, vir Mariæ, de qua natus est Jesus qui vocatur
Christus. Sancte Joseph, pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi, ora pro nobis
clientibus tuis, nunc et in hora mortis nostræ.

No, the hand of the Lord is not too short to save,
    nor his ear too dull to hear.
Rather, it is your crimes
    that separate you from your God,
It is your sins that make him hide his face
    so that he does not hear you.

Proverbs 24:17-18
Do not rejoice when your enemies fall,
    and do not let your heart be glad when they stumble,
or else the Lord will see it and be displeased,
    and turn away his anger from them.

Why not actual flesh and blood in the accidents?
Cyril of Alexandria, 444AD
> It was suitable for him to be in us divinely by the Holy Spirit. It was
also suitable for him to be mingled with our bodies by his holy flesh and
precious blood, which we possess as a lifegiving Eucharist, in the form
of bread and wine. God feared that seeing actual flesh and blood placed on
the holy tables of our churches would terrify us. Humbling himself to our
infirmities, God infuses into the things set before us the power of life. He
transforms them into the effectiveness of his flesh, that we may have them for
a lifegiving participation, that the body of life thus might be found in us
as a lifeproducing seed. Do not doubt that this is true. Christ plainly says,
“This is my body. This is my blood.” In faith, receive the Savior’s
word. Since he is the truth, he cannot lie. You will honor him. The wise
John says, “He that receives his witness has set his seal that God is
true. For he whom God sent speaks the words of God.” The words of God,
of course, are true. In no way whatsoever can they be false. Although we
cannot understand how God does that, yet he himself knows the way of his works.

In the Old Covenant, as a testimony and memorial you had to give your own son's
piece of flesh as an offering to God. In the New Covenant, it is God's own Son
who gives the piece of His Holy flesh for the world. As the Lord Himself said
"this cup is the New Covenant in My blood" (Luke 22:20), the same cup He
commanded to consecrate likewise perpetually, saying "do this in My memorial".
(Luke 22:19)

Super-Eucharistic verses:
Luke 24:30-31, 24:35
When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it,
and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him;
and he vanished from their sight.
...
Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known
to them in the breaking of the bread.
