Domine Jesu Christe, Fili Dei, miserere mei, peccatoris.

Ave Joseph, fili David, juste, vir Mariæ, de qua natus est Jesus qui vocatur
Christus. Sancte Joseph, pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi, ora pro nobis
clientibus tuis, nunc et in hora mortis nostræ.

No, the hand of the Lord is not too short to save,
    nor his ear too dull to hear.
Rather, it is your crimes
    that separate you from your God,
It is your sins that make him hide his face
    so that he does not hear you.

Proverbs 24:17-18
Do not rejoice when your enemies fall,
    and do not let your heart be glad when they stumble,
or else the Lord will see it and be displeased,
    and turn away his anger from them.

On the Inscription of the Acts:
> In speaking of St. Peter, the recollection of another Petier [Flavian,
Bishop of Antioch, at the time the discourse was written,] has come to me, the
common father and teacher, who has inherited his prowess, and also obtained
his chair. For this is the one great privilege of our city, Antioch, that it
received the leader of the apostles as its teacher in the beginning. For it
was right that she who was first adorned with the name of Christians, before
the whole world, should receive the first of the apostles as her pastor. But
though we received him as teacher, we did not retain him to the end, but gave
him up to royal Rome. Or rather we did retain him to the end, for though
we do not retain the body of Peter, we do retain the faith of Peter, and
retaining the faith of Peter we have Peter.

A Roman synod under Damasus in 378 writes to the Emperors Gratian and
Valentinian II:
> Certain bishops, unworthy pastors, have carried their insolence and contempt
to the point of refusing obedience to the Bishop of Rome.
